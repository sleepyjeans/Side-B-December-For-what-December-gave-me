    <h2>December 01</h2>
    <p>
      My dearest April,<br><br>
      I didn’t know how to say this out loud, so I decided to leave it here instead.
      From the moment you reached out to me again, I felt something settle into place.
      Like I was being gently pulled back to where I was always meant to be.
      There’s something about you that feels impossible to resist.
    </p>

    <img src="april1.jpeg">

    <p>
      You find your way into my dreams more often than I expect.
      You make my worries feel smaller, softer, easier to carry.
      When I think about you, the noise in my head goes quiet,
      and for a moment, everything feels simple.
      If I’m lucky enough to feel this closeness until my last breath,
      I know I’ll be grateful for it.
      Being with you already feels like a gift I didn’t know I was allowed to have.<br><br>
      With love, Michalis
    </p>

    <h2>December 02</h2>
    <p>
      My April,<br><br>
      I know your days are long and tiring.
      I know how much of yourself you give away to help others before the day is even over.
      And yet, somehow, you still find space for me in your busy schedule.
      Even in the quiet in-between moments, you choose to reach out to spam me with TikToks
      or send me cute angry cat pics.
    </p>

    <img src="april2.jpeg">

    <p>
      Thank you for making room for me in a life that already asks so much of you.
      I see your effort and I feel your love.
      And I’m grateful for you, always.<br><br>
      With love, Michalis
    </p>

  <!-- DECEMBER 03 -->
  <div class="letter">
    <h2>December 03</h2>
    <p>
      My love, April,<br><br>
      You have no idea how special you are to me.
      You’re the only one I don’t mind losing sleep for,
      the only one I can never get tired of talking to,
      and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day.
    </p>

    <img src="april3.jpeg">

    <p>
      You’re the only one who can make me smile without trying,
      bring my mood up without intending to,
      and affect my emotions with every action of yours.
      I can’t explain it with just words how much you mean to me,
      but you’re the only one I’m afraid of losing
      and the only one I want to keep forever.<br><br>
      With all my heart, Michalis
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DECEMBER 04 -->
  <div class="letter">
    <h2>December 04</h2>
    <p>
      To my beautiful girl, April,<br><br>
      Your presence wraps around my soul like the softest blanket on the coldest stormy night.
      When the world feels harsh and unforgiving, you become my second home —
      warm, gentle, and endlessly comforting.
    </p>

    <img src="april4.jpeg">

    <p>
      I treasure the quiet moments we share on call,
      the way my face hurts from smiling,
      and how everything you say feels amplified when I can see you.
      You are my cozy corner in this world,
      my safe space when life’s storms rage.<br><br>
      Forever yours, Michalis
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DECEMBER 05 -->
  <div class="letter">
    <h2>December 05</h2>
    <p>
      To my most patient girl, April,<br><br>
      I am endlessly grateful for the way you stay,
      especially when I’m stubborn and try to push you away.
      You see past my rough edges and hold me close without making me feel like too much.
    </p>

    <img src="april5.jpeg">

    <p>
      You walk beside me even when I’m unsteady.
      Sometimes I still can’t believe how lucky I am that you chose me —
      and that you keep choosing me.
      I promise to spend every day trying to be the partner you deserve.<br><br>
      Yours truly, Michalis
    </p>

    <h2>December 06</h2>
    <p>
      To my gorgeous April,<br><br>
      I’m constantly in awe of your beauty,
      but it’s so much more than what meets the eye.
      It’s in your laugh, your grace, and the way you speak with such kindness.
    </p>

    <img src="april6.jpeg">

    <p>
      I love your mind, the way you think and teach me without judgment.
      You are the perfect harmony of a gentle soul and stunning intellect.
      In Greek, we say people like you are love letters —
      because their very existence is a message of beauty and grace.<br><br>
      With all my love, Michalis
