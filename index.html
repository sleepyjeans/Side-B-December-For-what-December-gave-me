      <h2>December 01</h2>
      <p>
     My dearest April,
I didn’t know how to say this out loud,
 so I decided to leave it here instead.
From the moment you reached out to me again, I felt something settle into place.
 Like I was being gently pulled back to where I was always meant to be.
 There’s something about you that feels impossible to resist.
      </p>

      <img src="april1.jpeg" alt="Portrait">

      <p>
        You find your way into my dreams more often than I expect.
 You make my worries feel smaller, softer, easier to carry.
 When I think about you, the noise in my head goes quiet,
 and for a moment, everything feels simple.
If I’m lucky enough to feel this closeness until my last breath, I know I’ll be grateful for it.
 Being with you already feels like a gift I didn’t know I was allowed to have.

        With love, Michalis

      <h2>December 02</h2>

      <p>
       My April,
        
I know your days are long and tiring.
 I know how much of yourself you give away to help others before the day is even over.
 And yet, somehow, you still find space for me in your busy schedule.
Even in the quiet in-between moments, you choose to reach out to spam me with TikToks or send me cute angy cat pics.
      </p>

      <img src="april2.jpeg" alt="Drawing">

      <p>
        Thank you for making room for me in a life that already asks so much of you.
 I see it your effort and I feel your love.
 And I’m grateful for you, always.
With love,
 Michalis

      <p>
       My love, April,
        
You have no idea how special you are to me.
        Your’re the only one I don’t mind losing sleep for,
        the only one who I can never get tired of talking to,
         and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day.
        
      </p>

      <img src="april3.jpeg" alt="Drawing">

      <p>
        You’re the only one who can make me smile without trying, 
        bring my mood up without the intention 
    to and affect my emotions with every action of yours. 
        
        I can’t explain it with just words how much you mean to me, but you’re the only one I’m afraid of losing and the only one I want to keep in my life forever.

        With all my heart, Michalis.

      <h2>December 04</h2>

      <p>
      To my beautiful girl, April
         
        your presence wraps around my soul like the softest blanket on the coldest stormy night. 
        When the world feels harsh and unforgiving, you become my second home, so warm and gentle, and your presence so comforting.
I find myself treasuring those quiet moments we share when we’re on call together,
        how my face hurts from smiling, and how everything else you say to me
          feels so amplified by being able to see your beautiful face with every word.
        
        
      </p>

      <img src="april4.jpeg" alt="Drawing">

      <p>
        The memory of us simply being together fills my heart with a warmth that no fire could ever match.
You are my cozy corner in this world, my safe space when life's storms rage. 
        Your giggles are the melody that turns my house into a home,
          and your love is the light that guides me through even the darkest nights.

        Forever yours, Michalis.

      <h2>December 05</h2>

      <p>
     To my most patient girl, April
        
I am endlessly grateful for the way you stay, especially when I'm impossibly stubborn and try to push you away.
        I know getting through to me feels like an uphill battle, so I'm forever thankful that you keep choosing me even when I'm unsteady.
You have this remarkable gift of seeing past my rough edges and holding me close without ever making me feel like too much to handle.
        Even when I hurt you, you remain so steady.
        
        
      </p>

      <img src="april5.jpeg" alt="Drawing">

      <p>
        How do you love me through my most impossible moments with such grace? 
   You see the person I'm becoming even when I can't see it myself,
        and you choose to walk beside me through every stubborn step.

          Sometimes I still can't believe how lucky I am that you chose me, and that you continue to choose me.
        I promise I will spend every day trying to be the partner you deserve.

        Thank you for never giving up on me.
            Yours truly, Michalis
